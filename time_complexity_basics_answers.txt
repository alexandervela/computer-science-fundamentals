1. What is time complexity and what is its relation to algorithms?

A: Time complexity is a function that is used to estimate the amount of time it takes for a program to execute. Its relation to algorithms is that time complexity measures how long it takes an algorithm to execute and therefor how efficient it is.

2. What is runtime?

A: Runtime refers to the physical time duration of an algorithm and is often used synonymously with time complexity.

3. How is the runtime of an algorithm calculated?

A: Runtime is calculated graphically, with runtime being measured as the input size increases.

4. Name the six types of algorithm growth rates we saw in this checkpoint and list them in order of most efficient to least efficient. Now Google another algorithmic growth rate not covered and place it in the correct spot in your list.

A:
Constant Growth Rate
Logarithmic Growth Rate
Linear Growth Rate
Log-Linear Growth Rate
Quadratic Growth Rate
* Cubic Growth Rate
Exponential Growth Rate

5. Choose one of the algorithmic growth rates from the last question and make a comparison to a real-life situation.

A:
Constant Growth Rate Example: Carnival attendees waiting to get on a ride. Regardless of wether it's 40 people in line or 100 people, the ride only seats 20 people and will always last for 5 minutes. Neither of which change as the line of people grows. 

6. Determine the time complexity of the following snippet of code. It is commonly known as a linear search.

FUNCTION linearSearch(array, target)
 FOR each number in the array
   IF number = target THEN
     RETURN true
   END IF
 END FOR
 RETURN false
END FUNCTION

A: Linear Growth Rate - Time Complexity of O(n).

7. Determine the time complexity of the following snippet of code.

FUNCTION foo(array)
 FOR each number in the array
   FOR each number in the array
     print "Hello"
   END FOR
 END FOR
END FUNCTION

A: Quadratic Growth Rate - Time Complexity of O(n^2).

8. Determine the time complexity of the following snippet of code. It is commonly known as the Fibonacci sequence.

FUNCTION fibonacci(number)
 IF number < 1 THEN
   ERROR
 ELSE IF number = 1 or 2 THEN
   RETURN 1
 ELSE
   CALL fibonacci WITH number - 2 RETURNING twoBack
   CALL fibonacci WITH number - 1 RETURNING oneBack
   RETURN twoBack + oneBack
 END IF
END FUNCTION

A: Exponential Growth Rate - Time Complexity of O(2^n).

9. Out of the code snippets you just saw, which is the most time efficient?

A: The code snippet from problem 6.
