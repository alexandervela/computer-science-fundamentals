1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: Searching for your car in a parking lot.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Searching for a book in a library.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: A linear search because a binary search would be rendered ineffective due to the fact that the list is unsorted. There is no guarantee that the items on the left side of the middle item are lesser than it or that the items on the right are greater.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: A binary search because each iteration would drastically decrease the amount of items left to search, halving the item list which each iteration until the item is found. While a linear search would have to search a million items one by one if the item happened to be the last item in the list.


Programming Assignment:

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A:
```
function findWord(dictionary, word) {
  var low = dictionary[0];
  var high = dictionary.length -1;
  
  while(low <= high) {
    var mid = (low + high)/2;
    if (dictionary[mid] > word) {
      high = mid -1;
    } else if (dictionary[mid] < word) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  } return "Word not found";
}
```

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A:
```
function netFish(tank, targetfish) {
   var net = null, fish;
   for(var i = 0; i < tank.length; i++) {
     fish = tank[i];
     if(fish === targetfish){
       net = i;
       break;
     }
   }
   return net;
 };
```
