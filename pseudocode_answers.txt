Short Answer

Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: It is helpful for listing the steps needed to create the desired algorithm. It is not written in any specific programming language so it can be applied to any desired language.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: You would receive an error as pseudocode is written in any programming language and therefore is not accepted by computers. It is human read only.

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:


Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number
  PRINT first number
ELSE IF the second number is greater than the first number
  PRINT second number
ELSE
  PRINT "numbers are equal"
END IF

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FUNCTION
SET number to 1
WHILE number is equal to or less than 100
   INCREMENT number by 1
   RETURN number
END WHILE

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION
INPUT entry
FOR
IF entry is equal to phonebook entry
    PRINT the phonebook entry 
IF NOT
    PRINT string "Sorry entry not found"
END IF
END FOR


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phoneBook = [2403675582,2404271234,3019567723];

function findEntry(entry) {
    for(var i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++) {
        if (phoneBook[i] == entry) { 
          return phoneBook[i];
        }
    } return "Sorry entry not found";
}
